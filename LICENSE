                       Version 1, 01 August 2024

Copyright (C) 2024 SeedPod.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

TThis license governs the use, distribution, and modification of the SeedPod codebase. It is intended to protect the intellectual property of Jedidiah Ayobamidele Olugbenga and or SeedPod while providing clear guidelines on the permissible use of the SeedPod Codebase. By accessing or using the Codebase, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions outlined in this license.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"Codebase" refers to all source code, scripts, binaries, documentation, and other materials included in the SeedPod repository.
"You" refers to any individual or entity that accesses or uses the Codebase.
"Copyright Holder" refers to Jedidiah Ayobamidele Olugbenga and or SeedPod.
"Modification" refers to any changes or alterations made to the Codebase.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You are permitted to view and use the Codebase for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may use the Codebase internally within your organization for non-commercial purposes. You may distribute the Codebase, in its original form, for non-commercial purposes, provided that all copies include the original copyright notice and this license.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

You must not use the Codebase to circumvent technological protection measures or any other restrictions that would limit the rights granted under this license. This includes ensuring compliance with:

    a) Nigeria's Copyright Act: Protects the rights of copyright holders and includes provisions against unauthorized copying, distribution, and circumvention of copyright protection measures.

    b) WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT): Provides international standards for the protection of copyrighted works in the digital environment, including measures to prevent the circumvention of digital rights management (DRM) and technological protection measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's Codebase as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

If you modify the Codebase and convey it, you must in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    b) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way.

    c) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey the Codebase in object code form under the terms of this license, but you must comply with the following conditions:

    a) When conveying the object code as part of a physical product (including physical distribution media), you must also include the Corresponding Source on a durable physical medium that is commonly used for software interchange.

    b) If you convey the object code as part of a physical product, you may also provide a written offer valid for at least three years (or as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model) to provide anyone who possesses the object code with either:
        i. A copy of the Corresponding Source for the software covered by this license, on a durable physical medium for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveyance, or
        ii. Access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) You may convey individual copies of the object code along with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source, as long as this is done occasionally and non-commercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer.

    d) If you offer access to the object code from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), you must also offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way, at no additional charge. The Corresponding Source may be on a different server, provided clear instructions are provided for accessing it. You must ensure that the Corresponding Source remains available for as long as necessary to meet these requirements.

    e) You may convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided that you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source are being offered to the general public under the terms described above.

Any separable portion of the object code whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library is not required to be included when conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

If you convey the object code as part of a User Product and transfer the right of possession and use to the recipient, you must also provide Installation Information. This includes any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information necessary to install and execute modified versions of the Codebase from its Corresponding Source. This requirement does not apply if you or any third party cannot install modified object code on the User Product (e.g., if the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to provide ongoing support, warranty, or updates for the modified Codebase or User Product.

The Corresponding Source and Installation Information provided must be in a publicly documented format and accessible without requiring special passwords or keys for unpacking, reading, or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Additional Terms that apply to the entire Codebase will be treated as part of this License to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If Additional Terms apply only to specific parts of the Codebase, those parts may be used separately under the Additional Terms, but the remainder of the Codebase remains governed by this License.

    b) When conveying a copy of the Codebase, you may choose to remove any Additional Terms from that copy or from any part of it. If the Additional Terms require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the Codebase, you must comply with such requirements. You may also add Additional Terms to any material you add to the Codebase, provided you have the appropriate copyright permissions.

    c) Notwithstanding other provisions of this License, if you add material to the Codebase and have authorization from the copyright holders of that material, you may include Additional Terms that:
        i. Disclaim warranties or limit liability differently from Sections 15 and 16 of this License.

        ii. Require preservation of specific legal notices or author attributions in the added material or in any notices displayed by works containing it.

        iii. Prohibit misrepresentation of the origin of the added material, or require marking modified versions of such material as different from the original.

        iv. Limit the use of names of licensors or authors of the material for publicity purposes.

        v. Decline to grant rights under trademark law for the use of trade names, trademarks, or service marks.

        vi. Require indemnification of licensors and authors by anyone conveying the material (or modified versions) with contractual assumptions of liability, for any liability directly imposed on those licensors and authors.

    d) Any non-permissive Additional Terms that are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of Section 10 of this License. If the Codebase contains a notice that it is governed by this License along with a term that constitutes a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document includes a further restriction but allows relicensing or conveying under this License, you may incorporate material governed by that license document into the Codebase, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive Additional Terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of Section 10. If the Codebase as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accordance with this section, you must place a statement of the Additional Terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms, in the relevant source files.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License or agree to its terms in order to receive a copy of the Codebase. However, any use, modification, or distribution of the Codebase implies acceptance of the terms of this License. By using, modifying, or propagating the Codebase, you agree to comply with all the terms and conditions set forth in this License.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Every recipient of the Codebase from you is granted an automatic, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Codebase solely in accordance with the terms of this license. This license is provided directly by you, the licensee, and is limited to the rights explicitly granted under this All Rights Reserved License.

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance with this license by third parties.

In the event of an entity transaction, which includes the transfer of control of an organization, the transfer of substantially all assets of an organization, the subdivision of an organization, or the merging of organizations, each party involved in the transaction who receives a copy of the Codebase also receives the rights to the Codebase that the party's predecessor in interest had or could provide, subject to the same license terms. This includes a right to obtain the Corresponding Source from the predecessor if it is available with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted under this license. For instance, you may not require additional fees, royalties, or charges for the use of the Codebase, nor may you initiate legal actions claiming that any patent rights are infringed by activities covered under this license.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

13. Use with the All Rights Reserved License.

If you use the Codebase in conjunction with other software under an "All Rights Reserved" license, you must ensure that the terms of this license are not violated.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

SeedPod and or Jedidiah Ayobamidele Olugbenga may publish revised and/or new versions of
the All Rights Reserved License from time to time. Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the All Rights Reserved License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by SeedPod and or Jedidiah Ayobamidele Olugbenga. If the Program does not specify a version number of the
All Rights Reserved License, you may choose any version ever published
by SeedPod and or Jedidiah Ayobamidele Olugbenga.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the All Rights Reserved License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the All Rights Reserved License as published by
    SeedPod and or Jedidiah Ayobamidele Olugbenga, either version 1 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    You should have received a copy of the All Rights Reserved License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.github.com/jedbert>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

The hypothetical commands `show w` should show the appropriate
parts of the All Rights Reserved License. Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
